Title: Keeping myself sharp
Date: 2016-11-19 9:53

Over the terms my programming ability has fluctuated going into study terms and then coop and then back. I feel like on study terms my code is more "academic" and consists of one-off hacks to get things working without thinking much of what happens later. When I'm working I think carefully about what I write and refactor as I go. Being a junior developer my code still looks like spaghetti and I believe I need to write more in order to get a "feel" for what works and doesn't.

Before I go to Disney Research for my internship I want to get familiar with pandas, scikit-learn, some DL learning library (Tensorflow?) and STAN. I'm not sure how I want to do this though. I could compete on Kaggle. Or I could try one of the graduate ML courses online which require coding, but those are just academic hacks and really most of the problem is just thinking things through.

I guess I can try to replicate a paper's results like [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html#sequence-to-sequence-models)

But then I want a computer with a GPU so this doesn't take forever to run. But I can't get a good deal on a laptop before I get to the US since my stipend doesn't arrive until then. Might be time to make a risky decision, but I'd rather wait until the time of best savings.
