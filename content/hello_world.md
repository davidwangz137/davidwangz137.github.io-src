Title: Hello World!

I've finally decided to go to blog format website and just use a library to handle all the bloggin instead of implementing my own. That would be fun but I feel like dedicating my time to other pursuits would be more interesting and be better since I'm not going to be a web developer. Saying that, back to work. I'm going to post a few things here and now about what I'm currently doing and some thoughts I have. I keep a journal so I'll try to only write insightful things. I might add a comment system later so people to comment on what I write (and point out my glaring errors/fallacies) but that is for another time.
